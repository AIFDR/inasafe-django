# Setup pycharm to work with a remove docker development environment

## Build your dev docker image

This image extents the production one, addding ssh to it. You must
have built the production one first!

```
cd docker-dev
./build.sh
```

## Run the dev container

We provide a script to start the container:

```
scripts/run_django_dev_server.sh
```

Which should produce output like this:

```
Running django development server with option
Access it via ssh on port 1122 of your host
Use these connection details:

  user: docker
  password: docker

to log into the container via ssh or when setting up your
pycharm remote python environment.

Access it via http on port 1180 of your host
after starting the dev server like this:

python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:1180
